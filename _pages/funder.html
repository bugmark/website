			<div class="section-content pb-5">
				<p>Unlike Bug bounty systems : tradable contracts at market prices.</p>
				<p>Unlike kicktstarter campaigns: finegrained contracts attached to Github issues.</p>
				<p>Unlike social signals : a positive outlet for priorities and developer support.</p>

					<p align="left"> Sign up on Bugmark.net with your Github account.</p>
					<p align="left"> If you want to report issues, click on issues in the menu and report your issue with required details. Propose a smart cotract: "I will invest $18, if I can collect $20 on July 1 if bug 31337 is unfixed."</p>
					<p align="left"> Vinod, a developer sees the smart contract proposal. He counter-offers: "I will invest $2 and collect $20 on July 1 if bug 31337 is fixed."</p>
					<p align="left"> The smart contract is formed automatically. You invest $18.25 and Vinod invests $2.25.</p>
					<p align="left"> Vinod fixes the bug and the project maintainer closes it. He will receive $20. The oracle that closed the smart contract receives $0.50. You lose the investment, but gain a feature, which has an incredibly higher value.</p>

      <div class="section-content pb-5">
        <p align="left"> If you own the fixed side of a contract(paying for a fix), and need to get your money out, you can sell your side of the contract partway through the fix (before the bug is entirely fixed, checked in, reviewed, etc.) - you will probably have
        to sell at a discount, effectively sponsoring the fix, during the time you held your side of the contract.</p>
        <p align="left"> If the underlying task of a contract is verified completely, but contract maturation has not been reached, then the person who completed the task can check in, and offer to sell her side of the conntract - this is a no brainer
          for an investor to purchase, as the task has been verified - the fixer just wants the liquidity right away instead of later - should be easy to arrange and depending on the price this can be fair and amneable to all. </p>

			<div class="section-content pb-5">
				<p>Descentralized - implemented as an Ethereum Dapp.</p>
				<p>Extensible by Researches - incentives can be modified and experimented with - easily!</p>
				<p>Straightforward for Developers - to the extent possible, we'll use garden variety tech and write full test suites.</p>
				<p>Unobtrusive - no changes should be required to existing project management systems (issue trackers, etc.), owners/managers of projects may participate as much or as little as desired.</p>
				<p>Pseudononymous - we are after intelligence, and obtaining that info often requires a degree of respect for privacy.</p>

									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Market competition</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p>Since it's a market there will be competition - project manager can get better costs with us than by approaching a dev individually where the developer may have an upper hand in deciding the costs/compensation.</p>

						<h3 class="cbp-nttrigger">Bugmark reduces time to fix issues</h3>
						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p>Since each offer has an expiry date, the developer accepts issues based on fcfs basis, further the contracts involve a maturity period, and the developer would only accept new positions/partial work which she/he can aim to get resolved in the given time period.</p>
							<ul class="cbp-ntsubaccordion">
								<li>
									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Task management</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p>Big projects involve a lot of tasks, investment prevents a developer from taking more issues than she/he can be accountable for. This ultimately leads to more issues getting resolved instead of partial unfixed work.</p>
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Partial Work</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p>Collaborative work is incentivised, this supports an efficient open source culture.</p>
