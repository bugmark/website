					<p align="left"> Sign up on Bugmark.net with your Github account.</p>
					<p align="left"> If you want to fix issues, click on issues in the menu and see a list of issues from a project's Github repo, search for the issues with the tags "unfixed". Additionally, you can browse and sort offers, on the Offers page to find one with a maturity date and price that works for you.</p>
					<p align="left"> Click contribute to fix, invest in the bug, say $20, and define payment, say $40 that you can collect later when it gets fixed.</p>
					<p align="left"> A futures contract is automatically generated with the funder(project manager or other users) who also invested in the bug.</p>
					<p align="left"> Fix the bug. Project manager closes the issues, and you get your reward.</p>

						<li><i class="far fa-circle"></i>  She invests $20 to buy the other side(fixed) of the contract: she claims that the issue will get fixed by that date.</li>
						<li><i class="far fa-circle"></i>  Sneha does two out of the three scripts, then life happens and she realises she doesn't have time to complete the third script by the given deadline. So, Sneha checks in her partial work for the world to see, then offers to sell her side of the contract for $50.</li>

			<div class="section-content pb-5">
				<p>Descentralized - implemented as an Ethereum Dapp.</p>
				<p>Extensible by Researches - incentives can be modified and experimented with - easily!</p>
				<p>Straightforward for Developers - to the extent possible, we'll use garden variety tech and write full test suites.</p>
				<p>Unobtrusive - no changes should be required to existing project management systems (issue trackers, etc.), owners/managers of projects may participate as much or as little as desired.</p>
				<p>Pseudononymous - we are after intelligence, and obtaining that info often requires a degree of respect for privacy.</p>

									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Market Perspective</h4>

								<li>
									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Market competition</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p>Since it's a market there will be competition - project manager can get better costs with us than by approaching a dev individually where the developer may have an upper hand in deciding the costs/compensation.</p>

						<h3 class="cbp-nttrigger">Bugmark reduces time to fix issues</h3>
						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p>Since each offer has an expiry date, the developer accepts issues based on fcfs basis, further the contracts involve a maturity period, and the developer would only accept new positions/partial work which she/he can aim to get resolved in the given time period.</p>
							<ul class="cbp-ntsubaccordion">
								<li>
									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Task management</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p>Big projects involve a lot of tasks, investment prevents a developer from taking more issues than she/he can be accountable for. This ultimately leads to more issues getting resolved instead of partial unfixed work.</p>
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Partial Work</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p>Collaborative work is incentivised, this supports an efficient open source culture.</p>
