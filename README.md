# BUGMARK Website

This is a Jekyll website mimicking the Minima theme, but using Bootstrap4.

Minima's wrapper is replaced by BootStrap's container, in order to use Bootstrap's grid system and other features.

See the [live website](http://bugmark.github.io/website/) on GitHub pages.

To test this website locally : run ```jekyll serve``` in the repo dir.
