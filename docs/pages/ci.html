<h3>Zurich / July 2018</h3>

<p>
Two-Sided Markets are a form of <u>Collective
  Intelligence</u> that is well established.
<b>Market signals</b> in the form of <b>prices</b>
provide efficient guidance to direct resources
towards areas of greatest value.
</p>
<p>
We believe that Markets can be useful for software
development communities.  Price signals highlight
critical issues and motivate developers to align
their work with community needs.  We call this
style of organization <b>Market Driven
Development</b>.

With the support of Mozilla Innovation and the
Sloan Foundation, Bugmark has developed trading
systems and frameworks for running market
simulations and experiments.
</p>
<p>
In Q2 we conducted our first experiments with
automated simulations and hands-on team exercises.
</p>
<p>
In Q3 we will conduct interviews with people who
manage open-source project for large enterprise.
We seek to learn the common success metrics and
pain points in the <i>Corporate-Sponsored
Open-Source</i> community.
