> There is only one summit in life â€“ to have taken the measure in feeling of everything human. <br>-- Walter Horace Bruford


I'm a software engineer, currently learning and applying Machine Learning and Data Science passionately. I dream to put human soul into machines. I try to interpret meaning of every figure except random. I'm working on digitizing my thoughts and employing AI to augment my mind.

I'm also actively contributing to open source projects, check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/easton042)
