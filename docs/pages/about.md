### Our Value

Bugmark is a futures market for software issues.  Bugmark pioneers an approach
using a two-sided market, allowing both funders and workers to make offers that
are resolved auction style.  We believe the market signals generated by Bugmark
will be the most efficient way to allocate resources to high-value issues.

### Bugmark Status

Bugmark is currently an experimental project.  We are conducting market
simulations and user exercises to better understand trading dynamics and social
behavior.

### Our Team

Bugmark has participation from independant software contractors, Mozilla
Innovation, the CHAOSS Project, and Incentives Rearch, a consultancy that
specializes in economics incentive research and metrics.

### Software Assets

To date we have built:
- a trading exchange with a restful API
- a command-line interface
- client-side bots for trading automation
- server-side bots for experimental simulations

### Q2 Objectives
